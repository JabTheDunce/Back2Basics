                    <p>
                        Lectures take place in a physical location, you can see where a lecture takes place through your timetable in MyManchester.
                        Lectures are review sessions, this means that the content discussed in the lecture will be about the week before's content.
                        Lectures will clear up common misunderstandings, you may be given questions to do to test your understanding. 
                        This is also a chance for you to ask your lecturer any questions about the content.

                    <h1>Tutorials</h1>
                    <p>
                        For every course you have, you will have a tutorial. These tutorials will consist of smaller groups and a tutorial teacher.
                        Every week you will be given a tutorial sheet to do before the tutorial, during the tutorial, the solution and answer for this will be shown.
                        There may also be an in-tutorial sheet given if there is time. Tutorials and the tutorial sheets test your understanding of the week's content, and give you a chance to ask for help.

                    <p>
                        If you are confused on a course topic and need to ask for help, there are drop-in sessions for each course everyweek, you can see this on your timetable.
                        Drop in sessions are not mandatory, but I suggest going to these if you are not 100% on a topic.
